The purpose of this project was to analyze different data comparing dogs and cats, as well as general data taken from Austin's Animal Center over the last 8 years. I look into data such as comparing euthanization and adoption rates between the two, popular dogs breed that are taken in, and comparing adoptions between cat colors.
